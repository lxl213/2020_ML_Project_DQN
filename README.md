# ML-project-2020

The final project about Reinforcement Learning



### How to Run

```shell
cd ml_spring_2020 && python scripts
```

support two games now:

* Lunarlander , set `env_name` in  `configs/main_setting.py`  to `LunarLander-v2`
* Riverraid, set `env_name` in  `configs/main_setting.py`  to `Riverraid-v0`





### Some Requirements of Report:

> 1. Remember to save the trained agent. You are supposed to upload your trained agent onto the Blackboard system. TAs will use the provided code to evaluate your trained agent    ---- We can get the agent of in the learning process by interrupting if agent reach a certain score - like 5000
> 2. Please submit a detailed technical report. The technical report should include a learning curve plot showing the performance of your algorithm. **The x-axis should correspond to number of time steps and the y-axis should show the mean 100-episode reward as well as the best mean reward**.  
> 3. Besides, the technical report should include all the details of your projects, like the implementations, the experimental settings, the analysis of your results, etc.  --- **Including the relation of class**
